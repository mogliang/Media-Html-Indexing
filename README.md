# Indexing Media to Html
After several years of using personal PC, user shall has collected lots of pictures(videos) on hard disks.
For these old historical data, search may not be a good option, since user might have already forgot the file/folder name.

To help users manage these pricures/videos, i wrote this WPF tool. It can scan the specific disk folder, 
and generate index in HTML format. User can view the index.html to get a better idea on what he stored. 
Besides, this tool can generate the content page and embed user's images/video. This could be a fast way to view images in folder.
